    <h1>SUN</h1>
    <p>In 2025, the Sun is experiencing its solar maximum, the peak of its ~11-year cycle, which means it is much more active with increased sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This heightened activity can disrupt technology like satellite operations and GPS systems, cause radio blackouts, and produce spectacular auroras.  
</p>
<p>The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system, a massive, hot ball of hydrogen and helium that provides Earth with light and heat essential for life. Its immense gravity holds the planets in orbit, and its energy is generated through nuclear fusion in its core. </p>
