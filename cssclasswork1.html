        <p style="color: hsl(31, 100%, 24%);">Cadbury Dairy Milk is a British brand of milk chocolate manufactured by Cadbury since 1905. Every product in the Dairy Milk line is made exclusively with milk chocolate. In 1928, Cadbury introduced the "glass and a half" slogan to accompany the Dairy Milk chocolate bar to advertise the bar's higher milk content.

The bar was developed by George Cadbury Jr, and by 1914 it had become the company's best-selling product.[2] A century on it has retained its position as a market leader in Britain where it was ranked the best-selling chocolate bar in 2014.[3] Dairy Milk is also available in many other countries including China, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Bangladesh, as well as in the United States where it is manufactured and distributed by the Hershey Company under licence from Cadbury with a recipe that differs from the original.</p>
